    description: OWASP Benchmark test suites are designed to verify the speed and accuracy of software vulnerability detection tools for different
      languages. Each test suite is a fully runnable web app in particular language, it supports analysis by Static (SAST), Dynamic (DAST), and
      Runtime (IAST) tools that for that language. The idea is that since it is fully runnable and all the vulnerabilities are actually exploitable,
      it’s a fair test for any kind of vulnerability detection tool.  For more details on this project, please see the OWASP Benchmark Project home page.
